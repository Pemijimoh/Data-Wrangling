* **Gathered Data:** This include the tweet_json file, tweet_archive_enhanced csv file and image_predictions.tsv file.
* **Access Data:** Accessing the data collected includes checking tideness and quality issues. It can further be broken down into looking for missing data, invalid data, inaccurate data, inconsistent data and structural issues.
      After assessing the data programmatically and visually to check for the issues listed above, various steps were taken to clean the data, when cleaning is complete, the three data is merged together using tweet id.
